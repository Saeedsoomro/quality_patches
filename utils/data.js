      "Direct embroidery is the most economical, most popular, and fastest production style of embroidery techniques. It is often found on thicker apparel as well as chest and bicep locations. The process begins with a digitized file of your logo or design, then, using 100% polyester threads in a wide variety of colors, we embroider directly to any garment. Polyester threads are beneficial because they retain shape, recover stretch and are durable and vibrant. Direct embroidery is a professional, custom technique for any brand. You can recreate a variety of unique designs with different sizes, shapes and colors with extreme attention to detail. Whether you provide us with your apparel or workwear, or you select it from our inventory, Penn Emblem can create and stitch your design directly onto any garment, cap or accessory.Garment Sourcing ProvidedPSST Sanmar SupplierDecoration Applications are MFG on the East and West CoastOnline E-Commerce OrderingHigh Visibility, Nomex速 and Metallic threads are availableFull Package Available (Bagging, boxing and hang tags)To place a DIRECT EMBROIDERY order:LOGIN hereREQUEST password or CALL for a specialist",

    contentTwo:
      "Screen printing is an extremely popular method of embellishing imprint and promotional products, especially for t-shirts, hoodies, bags and other types of garment. This process is known for being efficient and versatile and can be done on virtually any surface. It involves ink transferring onto your selected wearable by images being laid out onto special mesh screens for each element of your design and each color of the design is then applied with ink layer by layer. Screen printing is ideal for cotton polyblend designs with an 8-10 color capacity. The best time to use screen printing is when you are placing a large bulk order, printing on an unconventional surface such as golf balls or mugs, or using a vibrant design or printing on a dark surface.",

    headingThree: "DYE SUBLIMATION",
    contentThree:
      "Dye Sublimation is easy and cost effective. It is used primarily on 100% Polyester garments or man made products. The process begins with choosing your design and printing it on sublimation paper and then pairing it with a polyester textile. The digitally printed ink on the paper turns into a gaseous state using heat (between 350-400 degrees) and pressure for a set amount of time. The gas then penetrates the shirt and solidifies and your design is complete. Dye Sublimation is best used with white or grey goods and is ideal for bicycle jerseys, shorts, socks, foam trucker hats, bandanas, masks, mugs, key chains, promotional products and more (has to be able to take a high heat of about 400 degrees for about 35-40 seconds depending on garment).",
